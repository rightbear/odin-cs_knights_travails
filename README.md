# odin-cs_knights_travails

This is the sixteenth project to work in the "JavaScript Course"

## The experience I get in this project

(2025/07/15) I complete this project with knowledges of JavaScript I learned in the previous course. I use Javascript concepts such as array, graph, breadth first search to build knightMoves function and other functions to tackle with the Knight's Travails problem in `knightMoves.js`. With advices in Assignment of the project, I try use the concept of breadth first search to find shortest path between two versices in a graph. I also use functions such as checkPosition and getNext to retrive the possible paths a knight chess can move to. Futhermore, I use Node.js command environment to run and debug my functions in `main.js`. This activity strengthens my skills in Node.js and JavaScript.
